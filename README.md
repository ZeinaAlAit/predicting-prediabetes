Random Forest algorithm
We're all human, we all have thoughts, and we
all get a little indecisive from time to time.
It's just part of being human, isn't it?
I am not eating healthy
am i prediabetic?
Pre-diabetes is when blood sugar levels are higher
than normal but not high enough yet to be diagnosed
as type 2 diabetes.
To solve this infinite questions, theres is one
model that could help us and that is : Random
Forest!
● Using random forest for pre-diabetes early
detection is good to find high-risk individuals early
● This can reduce the impact of type 2 diabetes in the
future.
I generated data including glucose, blood pressure, and insulin
levels adjusted according to BMI and physical activity.
Pre-diabetes status was determined based on glucose level, BMI, family
history, and diet. With n =1000.
